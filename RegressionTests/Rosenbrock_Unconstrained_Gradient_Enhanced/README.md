## Description

In this example, the 2D Rosenbrock function is minimized. The optimization problem is given as

```math
\text{minimize  } f(x_1,x_2) = (1-x_1)^2 + 100(x_2-x_1^2)^2
```

The contour plot of the function is displayed below:

## Running the test case

- To run the test case, run the python file "runOptimization.py" in terminal:

```
python runOptimization.py 
```
