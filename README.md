# RoDeO
RoDeo (Robust Design Optimization Package) is a package for simulation based global design optimization. It is specifically designed
for scientific/engineering applications, in which the objective function and constraints are evaluated by computationally expensive simulations. 

## Features of the RoDeO Package:
- Surrogate model based Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) strategy
- Full data-driven approach
- Easy and efficient treatment of inequality constraints
 
## External Libraries

 
## Build Support

- RoDeO uses cmake utility for the compilation and the build process. 
- First change directory to **src** and call **cmake**:
```
cmake -B ../build
```
   
- Then go to the **build** directory and call make for compilation: 
```
make 
```
