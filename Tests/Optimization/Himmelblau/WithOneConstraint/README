In this example, the Himmelblau test function is minimized with a constraint. The Himmelblau
function is given as

f(x1,x2) = (x1^2+x2-11.0)^2 + (x1+x2^2-7.0)^2

It has four identical local minima

f(3.0,2.0) = 0.0
f(-2.805118, 3.131312) = 0.0
f(-3.779319, -3.283186) = 0.0
f(3.584428, -1.848126) = 0.0


The box constraints for x1 and x2 are given as

-6.0 < x1 < 6.0
-6.0 < x2 < 6.0

The constraint is given as 

x1 + x2 > 4.0


Both the Himmelblau function and the constraint are implemented in the c-file "himmelblau.cpp". The program writes the function output and the constraint value (x1 + x2) to a file "objFunVal.dat".
